# nowcasting_DGMR
### Still underconstruction

- Implement [DGMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00954) model that is produced by Deep Mind to address radar nowcasting in meteorology.
- You can find more detail about the model architecture in [this supplementary](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03854-z/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3854_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) provided by Deep Mind.
- Pytorch 1.9.0 is used in this implementation
- Other people's [implementation](https://github.com/openclimatefix/skillful_nowcasting)
